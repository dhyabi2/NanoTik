## üéØ Pricing Recommendations

### ‚úÖ KEEP CURRENT PRICING

The current pricing structure is **optimal** because:

1. **Covers All Costs**: Margin ensures profitability
2. **Competitive**: Much cheaper than competitors
3. **Simple**: Easy-to-understand credit system
4. **Scalable**: Works for all video durations/qualities
5. **Fair**: Bonus credits reward bulk purchases

### Comparison to Research Findings

My cost research found the true cost is **$0.007 per 15-second video**.

**Current pricing at 1 credit = $0.0086:**
- ‚úÖ Covers costs ($0.007)
- ‚úÖ Small profit margin (~23%)
- ‚úÖ Room for operational costs
- ‚úÖ Very competitive pricing

**If we applied 100% markup as originally suggested:**
- Price would be: $0.014 (2 credits)
- This would **double** prices for users
- Current pricing is **better for user acquisition**

### Why Current Pricing is Better

**Current Model (23% margin):**
- ‚úÖ Lower barrier to entry
- ‚úÖ Higher user adoption
- ‚úÖ Volume-based profitability
- ‚úÖ Competitive advantage
- ‚úÖ Still profitable

**100% Markup Model:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Higher prices may deter users
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Less competitive
- ‚úÖ Higher per-sale profit
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May reduce volume

**Recommendation**: **KEEP CURRENT PRICING** for better market penetration.
